## background
This is a group research project I worked on when I was a research intern in [Laboratory of service computing technology and systems, Ministry of Education](http://grid.hust.edu.cn/kydw/gdyjry.htm). The research group consists of [Prof. Fangming Liu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/liufangming/zh_CN/index.htm), Qingyu Pei,   Qunli Li(research intern), Dawei zhou(research intern)

The research is about Energy-efficient Deep Neural Network Inference Scheduling At the Edge.

The main contribution of our work:

1. According to our best knowledge,we are the first to leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning to develop energy-efficient DNN inference scheduling algorithm.

2. We designed approriate State, action, reward and the environment for  the reinforcement learning scheduling algorithm

3. Our scheduling algorithm significantly outperforms traditional greedy-based  DNN inference scheduling  by 10 percent on average, in terms of energy efficiency.
