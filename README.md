## background
This is a research project on Deep Network Inference Scheduling Algorithm , conducted by a research group of the [Laboratory of service computing technology and systems, Ministry of Education](http://grid.hust.edu.cn/kydw/gdyjry.htm).
The research group consists of Prof.Fangming Liu, Qingyu Pei, Qunli Li(research intern), Dawei zhou(research intern)


## environment


## usage
 train

   ```
   
   # prepare data
   python data_u.py
   # train our model 
   # If the GPU related running environment is installed and configured, the command line --cuda can be added to use GPU training
   python run.py
   ```
